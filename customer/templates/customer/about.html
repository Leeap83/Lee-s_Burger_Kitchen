                    <p class="text-black">
                        Lee's Burger Kitchen or LBK as we are commonly known is named after the founder/head chef 
                        who started making homemade Burgers in his kitchen. LBK first started as a pop up business at markets, 
                        festivals local events. Eventually as our reputation grew so did demand, and we eventually opened our 
                        first LBK in the heart of Shrewsbury Town Centre.

                    <p class="text-black">
                        Easy it's the taste! <br>
                        Freshly made beef patties + locally sourced produce = one tasty burger. We like
                        to experiment with flavours and create a burger that not only we enjoy but hopefully so do our customers.
                        We also encourage our customers to create their own burger and if we like it we'll add it to our menu.
